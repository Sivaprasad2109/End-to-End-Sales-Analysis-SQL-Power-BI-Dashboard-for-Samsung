Tools Used:
Database: MySQL

Data Analysis: SQL

Data Visualization: Microsoft Power BI

Project Workflow
Data Loading: The initial dataset (samsung.csv) was loaded into a MySQL database to create a structured sales table.

Data Analysis: SQL queries were written to explore the data and answer key business questions.

Dashboard Creation: Power BI was connected to the MySQL database. The insights from the SQL queries were then used to build the charts and visuals for the final interactive dashboard.

Key Questions Answered
The analysis focused on answering the following questions:

What were the total units sold and total revenue?

Which product models were the top performers by sales and revenue?

What were the sales trends over different years and quarters?

Which regions generated the most revenue?

How did the sales of 5G devices compare to non-5G devices?

Final Dashboard
Below is a screenshot of the final interactive dashboard created in Power BI. The dashboard provides a clear overview of the sales performance and allows for interactive filtering by year and region.
